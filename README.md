# Openfire MUC Real-Time Block List Plugin

An Openfire plugin that subscribes to a real-time block list using Publish/Susbscribe (XEP-0060). As the pub/sub node is modified, the plugin immediately updates a ban list that applies to all MUC rooms.

This plugin is heavily inspired, and aspires to be compatible with, [Prosody's mod_muc_rtbl](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_muc_rtbl.html)
